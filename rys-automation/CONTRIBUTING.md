Thanks for your interest in *Record Your Story*!

## Branching
- Use feature branches: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
- Keep PRs under ~300 lines of diff when possible

## Definition of Done
- Code + minimal docs
- CHANGELOG updated if user-visible change
- Screenshot/GIF in the PR for UI changes
- Basic a11y pass (tab order, labels, aria)

## Releasing
- Tag with `vX.Y.Z` to trigger Release workflow (see `.github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml`).
