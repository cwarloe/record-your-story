## üö´ Out of Scope (Not in v2.0)

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- ‚ùå Mobile apps (native iOS/Android)
- ‚ùå Payment/monetization
- ‚ùå Advanced permissions (admin/editor/viewer)
- ‚ùå Video uploads
- ‚ùå Public profiles/discovery
- ‚ùå Analytics dashboard

**Rationale:** Focus on core "connected storylines" vision. These can be v3.0+.

---

## ü§ù Decision Framework

**When adding features, ask:**
1. Does this help find meaningful connections between events?
2. Does this support multiple timelines (work/family/personal)?
3. Does this leverage AI to enhance discovery?
4. Can we build it in 1 sprint (2 weeks)?

**If NO to 2+ questions ‚Üí defer to backlog**

---

## üìã Acceptance Criteria for v2.0 Release

**Before we can call it v2.0:**
- [x] Cloud authentication working
- [x] Events with photos/tags/rich text
- [ ] Search & filter working
- [ ] Edit/delete events
- [ ] Event connections (manual linking)
- [ ] Multiple timelines
- [ ] AI suggestions (at least basic keyword matching)
- [ ] @mentions with "Your Appearances" feed
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Performance: handles 100+ events smoothly

**Nice to have (can ship without):**
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced AI (NLP beyond keywords)
- PDF export
- Comments on events

---

## üöÄ Post-v2.0 Roadmap (v3.0 Ideas)

**Potential Future Features:**
- Shared family timelines (collaborative)
- AI-powered "story suggestions" (write this event for you)
- Import from social media (Facebook, Instagram)
- Voice recording for events
- Mobile apps (React Native)
- Monetization (premium AI features)

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps (This Week)

### **Immediate Tasks:**
1. **Agree on v2.0 scope** (this document)
2. **Start Sprint 1:**
   - Search & filter UI wireframe
   - Edit event flow diagram
   - Database query optimization for search

3. **Set up project board:**
   - GitHub Projects or Trello
   - Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done
   - Sprint planning every 2 weeks

---

## üìù Open Questions (To Discuss)

1. **AI Complexity:** Start with simple keyword matching or invest in NLP library (compromise: start simple, iterate)?
2. **Mentions Privacy:** Default to "auto-approve" or "approval required" for mentions?
3. **Timeline Limit:** Max number of timelines per user? (Suggest: 10)
4. **Connection Types:** Just "related" or specific types (same event, cause-effect, etc.)?
5. **Real-time Updates:** How aggressive? (Push notifications, websockets, or polling?)

---

**Does this scope align with your vision? Any features to add/remove/prioritize differently?** üöÄ

Let's finalize this roadmap and start building! üí™
