# Record Your Story - Product Roadmap

## üéØ Recommended Next Features

Based on the MVP foundation, here are prioritized feature additions to maximize value and user engagement.

---

## **Phase 2: Enhanced Usability** (2-3 weeks)

### 1. **Search & Filter** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Why**: Essential once users have 20+ events
**Effort**: Medium
**Features**:
- Text search across titles and descriptions
- Filter by date range (e.g., "Show 2020-2023")
- Filter by year/decade view
- Real-time filtering (no page reload)

**User Story**: "I have 50 life events and want to find all events from my college years"

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
- Add search input above timeline
- Filter events array before rendering
- Debounce search for performance
- Highlight matching text in results
```

---

### 2. **Rich Text Editor** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Why**: Stories deserve formatting (bold, italic, lists, links)
**Effort**: Low (using library)
**Features**:
- Bold, italic, underline text
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Hyperlinks
- Basic formatting toolbar
- Markdown export option

**User Story**: "I want to emphasize important moments and add links to photos/articles"

**Technical Approach**:
- Integrate Quill.js or TinyMCE (lightweight editors)
- Store HTML in event.description
- Sanitize HTML on render (XSS protection)

---

### 3. **Categories/Tags** ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why**: Organize events by theme (work, family, travel, etc.)
**Effort**: Medium
**Features**:
- Add multiple tags to each event
- Color-coded tag badges
- Filter timeline by tag
- Tag management (create/rename/delete)
- Predefined tags + custom tags

**User Story**: "I want to see only my 'Career' events or only 'Family' milestones"

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
event = {
  id: "123",
  title: "Promoted to Manager",
  date: "2023-05-15",
  description: "...",
  tags: ["career", "achievement"]  // New field
}
```

---

## **Phase 3: Visual Enhancement** (2-3 weeks)

### 4. **Photo Uploads** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Why**: Pictures make stories memorable
**Effort**: Medium
**Features**:
- Upload 1-5 photos per event
- Image thumbnails in timeline
- Lightbox/modal for full-size view
- Store as base64 in LocalStorage (or IndexedDB for larger files)
- Delete photos option

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
- Use <input type="file" accept="image/*">
- Convert to base64 or use IndexedDB

- Add image viewer modal
```

**Consideration**: LocalStorage has ~5MB limit. For many photos, migrate to IndexedDB (unlimited storage).

---

### 5. **Timeline Visualization** ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Effort**: Medium
**Features**:
- Vertical timeline with connecting lines
- Year/decade markers

---

### 6. **Dark Mode** ‚≠ê LOW PRIORITY
**Why**: User preference, modern expectation
**Effort**: Low
**Features**:

```

---

## **Phase 4: Collaboration & Sharing** (3-4 weeks)

**User Story**: "I want to share my wedding story with family via link"

**Technical Approach**:

---

## **üìä Recommended Priority Order**

### **Immediate Next Steps** (Pick 2-3)
1. **Search & Filter** - Users need this once they have data
2. **Rich Text Editor** - Better storytelling immediately
3. **Photo Uploads** - High visual impact

### **After First 2-3 Features**
4. **Categories/Tags** - Organization becomes important
5. **Timeline Visualization** - Differentiate from basic lists
6. **Dark Mode** - Quick win, user delight

### **Later / Optional**
7. **Share Events** - If users want to show others
8. **Multi-Timeline** - Only if users request it
9. **Cloud Sync** - Major undertaking, decide if needed
10. **Collaboration** - Family timeline use case
11. **AI Features** - Innovation layer

---

## **üöÄ Deployment: GitHub Pages**

Your MVP is pushed! To enable the live site:

### **Steps to Enable GitHub Pages**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/cwarloe/record-your-story/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select `master` branch
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your app will be live at: **https://cwarloe.github.io/record-your-story/**

---

## **üí° Strategic Recommendations**

### **Option A: Stay Simple & Ship Fast** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
Focus on **Search, Rich Text, Photos** (3 features). Ship v1.0 in 3-4 weeks.

**Why**: These 3 features make the app genuinely useful without adding complexity. Users can tell rich, searchable, visual stories.

### **Option B: Go Premium**
Build **Cloud Sync + Collaboration** to create a SaaS product.

**Why**: Only if you want to monetize ($5/mo subscription). Requires backend, auth, hosting costs.

### **Option C: Niche Down**
Focus on specific use case (e.g., "Family History Timeline" or "Career Journey Tracker").

**Why**: Targeted marketing, clearer value prop, specific feature set.

---

## **üé® Design Philosophy for Next Features**

### **Guiding Principles**:
1. **No Feature Should Require Tutorial** - Intuitive UI
2. **Mobile-First** - Most users will access on phones
3. **Data Portability** - Users can always export/own their data
4. **Privacy First** - Keep local-first architecture when possible
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Basic features work without advanced ones

### **Keep It Simple**:
- Don't add features "just because"
- Each feature should solve a real user pain point
- Validate assumptions: Ask your friend what THEY want

---

## **üìù Success Metrics**

To decide what to build next, track:
- How many events do users create? (If <10, improve entry UX)
- Do users export data? (If yes, they're invested)
- What do users ask for? (Build that!)
- Do users return weekly? (Engagement signal)

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (2 minutes)
2. **Share MVP with 5-10 people** (get feedback)
3. **Pick 2-3 features** from Phase 2/3 above
4. **Build iteratively** - ship small, ship often
5. **Revisit roadmap** after each feature

**Questions to Answer**:
- Who is the primary user? (Individual journaling? Family history?)
- What's the #1 pain point in the MVP? (Fix that first)
- Do you want to monetize? (Affects backend decisions)
