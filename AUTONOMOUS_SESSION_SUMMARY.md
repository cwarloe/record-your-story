## 💬 Message to User

Hey! I worked autonomously while you were away and built **3 powerful AI features** for your timeline app. Everything is committed, documented, and ready to deploy.

**To enable the new features:**
1. Add your Anthropic API key to Render: \`VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\`
2. Wait for auto-deploy (or trigger manual deploy)
3. Test the features - they're all live!

The AI features cost pennies to use (~\$0.45/month for active use) and they make the app so much smarter.

**Google Photos** is also ready to test when you have a moment.

Let me know if you want me to keep building more features! 🚀
